<html>
    <!--header and page title -->


    <!--Requirements DELETE:
    In the <head> element, set the title, which appears on the browser’s title bar. 
    The title should read: About <your-name>
    Put your name in a header, level 1.
    Put a recognizable picture of you using an <img> tag.
    Please use a paint program to resize and crop your image so that it is no larger than 500 by 500px (It does not have to be square).
    If the image looks squashed or stretched I’m going to take off points.
    The image should live in the same folder as your HTML page.-->


    <!--Personal Info-->

    <!--REQUIREMENTS: DELETE!:
    Have a header (level 2) that says: “Personal Info:”
    Next, use an unordered list (bullet points) and give me the following pieces of info:
        Your major (spell it out. Don’t abbreviate).
        Your high school, and the year you graduated.
        What year are you in, currently, at UVU.
        Your favorite flavor of ice cream (mmmm, ice cream).
        Make use bold text for each label like in the example that I provided below.-->

    Choose five books that you like the best, and list them in the order of your preference.
        Each title should be italicized. 
        Each author’s name should be in regular text.

    <!--Haiku-->
    <!--Requirements DELETe:
        Have a level-2 header with a title of your poem
    Have a sentence or two explaining your inspiration for the poem.
    Put your poem after the header.
    Each line should use line-breaks, not paragraph breaks.-->

    
    <!--Brief Essay-->

    <!--REQUIREMENTS DELETE: 
        Make a level-2 header titled something like: “My personal interests”
    Give me three paragraphs, with three or more sentences each. 
    In each paragraph talk about something you’re interested in.-->


    <!--Class Schedule-->
    <!--REQUIREMENTS DELETE: 
    Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”
    Create a table with 6 columns.
        Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. 
        Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.
    The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 
        If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).
    Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.
    List the classes you have as cells. 
        Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.  If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.  I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
    Fill up your schedule. 
        Make stuff up if you have to.  
        I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.  
        In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
    Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them. -->

    <!--EXTRA STUFF, Don't necessarily put it here though. 5 are required
        (2 points) Can you set a repeating background image? The text should still be readable.  Pick something that doesn’t make my eyes bleed, or I won’t give you credit.
    (2 points) can you change the font used in the body of the document to something besides Times New Roman (or whatever your browser uses by default)?
    (2 points) can you make your photo right-aligned on the page, and make the page’s text flow around it?
    (2 points) on all hyperlinks, can you make it so that the underline only appears when you mouse-over the link?
    (2 points) find a way to indent your poem, or center it on the page.
    
    Weekly Schedule
        (2 points) text alignment. On your schedule, can you find a way to have all the text vertically aligned to the top and horizontally aligned to the left (including the headers).
        (2 points) on your weekly schedule, can you fill in in each block so that each thing is color-coded in its own color (English is yellow, calculus is light red, work is light blue, etc)?
